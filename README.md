# VisualiserNEA
This project will be split into several files of different types. 
Firstly the model will be made and trained using Python with libraries TensorFlow (with keras built in) and a few other math related python libraries. 
Secondly code for a web page will be uploaded using HTML CSS and JS files. 
Using tensorflow.js the model made in python is to be imported into our JS script which allows the model to run and interact on a webpage without having to compute everything on a browser.
